# pig-dice-game

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print in John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

## ToDos

- [x] Make basic game functions in backend
- [x] Use Redis to store game state
- [x] Make front=end game lobby
- [x] Make front-end game play
- [x] GitHub build action & Heroku host
- [ ] Redis streams & Websocket
  - https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/streams/
- [ ] Add CORS so people can write their own fron-ends
- [ ] Work on a new game (probably pig (card game))

  // Things about the game that don't change once it's started.
  "gameSettings": {
    "gameSetting1": 3,
    "gameSetting2": "hello"
  },
  // Secret information, only available to some players
  "gameSecrets": {
    "some-player's-uuid": {
      "password": "asdf", // Used to prevent other players performing actions on your behalf.

### WebSocket API

If you get disconnected, you need to reconnect and re-listen to the game. You'll still be in the game so you don't need to rejoin it..
